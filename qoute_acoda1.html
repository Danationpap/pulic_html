<div class="panel">
  <p>But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful indeed, when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was ghastly, to exist without having any life: lifeless, in the night, to exist.”
― D.H. Lawrence, Lady Chatterley's.</p>

<button class="accordion">Section of a life 3</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>“Sitting in a corner, I live like a toad
Oh! How I love my room: my tiny abode!
Here I wake up; and I sleep in here
The world far away; yet virtually near
Not that I'm jailed in this place of grace
Just don't want to face another face”
― Munia Khan.</p>

  <p>“My doctors asked what was wrong when they found me pale faced and lifeless. I told them I spent an immense amount of time stuDYING.”
― Karen Quan, Better to be able to love than to be loveable.</p>

<button class="accordion">Section of a life 5</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>“Do I dare believe such an absurdly outrageous story that a man would die, lay lifeless in some tomb for three days and then somehow live again? Yet, if I dare to consider it, is that not exactly what I so desperately desire for this lifeless life of mine? And is Easter God’s tenderly outrageous way of telling me that that is exactly what I can have?”
― Craig D. Lounsbrough.</p>
